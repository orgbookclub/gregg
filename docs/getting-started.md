# Using this guide

Each group of commands has their own section under **Commands** in the sidebar. They contain what each command does, what argument(s) it takes, and how to use it.

The **Guides** contain the underlying processes behind the commands, and focuses more on _when_ different commands will be used.


!> Do not literally type out `<` `>` `[` `]` `|` etc. which are listed in the commands.
